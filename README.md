# credit-risk-classification
Module 20 Challenge

## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the creditworthiness of borrowers using historical lending data from a peer-to-peer lending service. The primary goal is to identify loans that are at high risk of default (labeled as `1`) versus those that are likely to be repaid (labeled as `0`).
